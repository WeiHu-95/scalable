Performace:
First attempt: result 330
Second attempt: 632
The improvement by generate change difference length of captures from 1-6 instead of specific length 6.(change on generate2 file by change the range to generate difference length file)

Time: the classify.log file shows how much time cost total on rasp-pi
and compare to local machine about 30 times slower

training: for training 150000 capchas using GPU on local machine around 2 hours, if using CPU around 5 hours.

Exceptions: there are few codes on generate file and classify file handle exceptions when if there are repeat file and some interrupt sitution happend.
